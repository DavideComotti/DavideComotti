# Hi, I'm Davide Comotti
I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical and Material Engineering at the University of Brescia, Italy. While, as of now, I'm attending my Master’s Degree (Laurea Magistrale) in Materials and Product Innovation Engineering at the University of Brescia, Italy.

This two-year program trains engineers in advanced materials, production processes, and innovative product design. Students acquire technical, modeling, and materials selection skills for high-performance, sustainable engineering applications. 


## About Me

I am a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate specializing in **Materials and Product Innovation**. 

My academic training focuses on the complete lifecycle of engineering materials, from:

- Production and processing  
- Structure–property relationships  
- Materials selection  
- Mechanical design  
- Industrial product development  

I combine experimental data analysis, computational modeling, and engineering design tools to bridge material science and applied engineering problems.

## Featured Project

### Study of the Angular Distribution of Cosmic Ray Muons

Bachelor thesis project involving experimental detector data and Monte Carlo simulation.

Main components of the project:

- Processing of particle detector data in ROOT format
- Data extraction using `uproot`
- Data cleaning and timestamp-based validation
- Merging and transformation into zenith angles (0°–90°)
- Histogram analysis using `matplotlib`
- Temporal stability analysis using heatmaps
- Monte Carlo simulation using EcoMug
- C++ integration in Python using `cppyy`
- Experimental vs theoretical distribution comparison

This project demonstrates:

- Scientific programming
- Experimental data processing
- Monte Carlo methods
- C++ / Python interoperability
- Statistical validation of physical models
