# Hi, I'm Davide Comotti
I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical and Material Engineering at the University of Brescia, Italy. While, as of now, I'm attending my Master’s Degree (Laurea Magistrale) in Materials and Product Innovation Engineering at the University of Brescia, Italy.

This two-year program trains engineers in advanced materials, production processes, and innovative product design. Students acquire technical, modeling, and materials selection skills for high-performance, sustainable engineering applications. 


## About Me

I am a Mechanical Engineering specializing in **Materials and Product Innovation**. My studies focus on the complete lifecycle of engineering materials, from:

- Production and processing  
- Structure–property relationships, with advanced calculation of the stresses to which a given object is subjected
- Materials selection  
- Mechanical design  
- Industrial product development  

I combine these aforementioned skills with experimental data analysis, computational modeling and Monte Carlo methods learnt from my bachelor thesis project:

### Study of the Angular Distribution of Cosmic Ray Muons

Where I compared data from the INFN detector in Legnaro with the theoretical data obtained through a parametric cosmic ray muon generator, which is based on Monte Carlo simulations.

This project demonstrates:

- Scientific programming
- Experimental data processing
- Monte Carlo methods
- C++ / Python interoperability
- Statistical validation of physical models
